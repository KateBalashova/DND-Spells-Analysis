# 🧙‍♂️ Dungeons and Dragons Spells Dataset Analysis

Welcome to our project exploring the world of **Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) spells** through data analysis and visualization. This repository contains everything from raw data and code notebooks to reports and final deliverables.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

We analyzed the **Dungeons and Dragons Spells (2024)** dataset, which includes 315 spells described by 27 attributes such as spell name, level, school of magic, components, range, and class availability.

Our goal was to answer two key questions:

1. **How do spell names and descriptions differ across character classes?**
2. **How do spell level and casting components influence spell range?**
